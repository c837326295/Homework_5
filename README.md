# Homework_5
The data presented in this repository includes cleaning up homicide data from
2007 to 2018 across the US. 

Load the csv file, data/homicide-data.csv, from the Washington Post
file_path <- "data/homicide-data.csv"
homicide_data <- read_csv(file_path)

This dataset provides a lot of awesome information including cities,
victim information, location, and the status of the case.

It's important to note that the date_reported column is **NOT** in date format.
  
Enjoy!!
